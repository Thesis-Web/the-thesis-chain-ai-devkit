# Evaluation & Metrics

Do not measure “tokens used.” Measure value.

Suggested metrics:
- reduction in review time
- defect prevention (before merge)
- number of contradictions caught
- clarity improvements (missing definitions, broken references)
- false positive rate

AI should be evaluated like any other tool: by outcomes and cost.
